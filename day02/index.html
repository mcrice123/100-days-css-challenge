<!--
    This is my practice code for Day 2. The animation doesn't work,
    even though I added the javascript and css files the same way
    that works for the copied code from the solution AND I included
    the jquery link in the same manner.

    I'll have to come back to this one later. I learned a lot from it,
    even though it's not done. Besides, I now know the proper set up for
    working with Sass and Jquery and that will help in the next exercise.
